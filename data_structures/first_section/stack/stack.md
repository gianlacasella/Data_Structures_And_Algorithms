# Stacks
## Stacks examples on C++ and Python
* [Stack on C++](stack.cpp)
* [Stack on Python](stack.py)
  
## Information

* LIFO
  
* Basic methods:
  1. Push: adds element to the stack
  2. Pop: removes element from the stack and returns it
   
* Some uses:
  1. Flip a list
  2. Arithmetic operations evaluation
  3. First come first serve prioritization
  4. Format verification

* Limitations:
  1. By default you cannot get a specific element from a stack
  2. Cannot reorder a stack
   
* Aditional methods:
  1. Top: returns the first element of the stack
  2. Isempty: returns true if it's empty and false if it is not
  3. Size: returns the stack size
  4. (Private) Resize: adds or removes an element from the stack
   
* Examples:
  1. Flipping a collection of elements
  2. Arithmetic operations
  3. Format checking
